# Docker volumes

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure and OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker. Volumes have several advantages over bind mounts:

- Easier to back up or migrate.
- Can be manage volumes using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API.
- Can be shared among multiple containers.
- Volume drivers let you store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, to encrypt- the contents of volumes, or to add other functionality.
- The volumeâ€™s contents exist outside the lifecycle of a given container.
